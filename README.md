# [CS 3310] Project 1 - Graph Traversal
By: Thomas Truong\
Bronco ID: 014426906

## Instructions
- Write a Java program (based on a graph traversal algorithm youâ€™ve learned in this class) that, for a given undirected graph, outputs: the vertices of each connected component.
  - Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search.
- Your programs should take inputs from a file via the command line with the following structure in the input file. Each line of the input file represents a graph. The first number in a line specifies the number of vertices in the graph. Then pairs of vertices define the edges.
- An example of an input file is as follows:
  ```
  5 (1,2) (3,4) (3,5) (4,5)
  4 (1,2) (2,3) (1,4)
  ```
- It specifies two graphs. The first graph has five vertices (1,2,3,4,5) and four edges. The second graph has four vertices (1,2,3,4) and three edges.
- Proper output should look (something) like:
  ```
  Graph1:
  Two connected components: {1 2} {3 4 5}
  Graph2:
  One connected component: {1 2 3 4}
  ```
- You must test your programs on a nontrivial input file (with at least 3 graphs and each graph having 7-10 nodes). Your output should be formatted nicely so that it is easy to read.
- Your program should use "good style". See the separate handout on style requirements for CS-3310 programs.
- **Hint**: Connected component: in graph theory, a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.
